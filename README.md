Web Forms

In this assignent we created online forms collecting some sort of personal information about potential participants. The from includes things like age gender and hair color. The goal was to create a form that is AA compatible with WCAG AA guidelines.

One of the big things that makes my form more accesible is the fact that it is copatible with voiceover. When using whatever your machine might use to read the text on the screen, my form will work and will allow the user to be walked through using a combination of directions and keystrokes. Also, when selecting gender there are options for male, female, non-binary, and prefer not to answer. These options give the user complete freedom in what they want to share with the form.
